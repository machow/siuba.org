The `summarize()` creates new columns in your table, based on an aggregation.
Aggregations take data and reduces it to a single number.
When applied to grouped data, this function returns one row per grouping. 

```{python}
from siuba.data import mtcars
from siuba import _, summarize, group_by, select
```

## Summarize over all rows

```{python}
mtcars >> summarize(avg_mpg = _.mpg.mean())
mtcars
```

## Summarize over groups

Use `group_by()` to split the data up, apply some aggregation, and then combine results.

```{python}
(mtcars
  >> group_by(_.cyl)
  >> summarize(
       avg = _.mpg.mean(),
       range = _.mpg.max() - _.mpg.min(),
       avg_per_cyl = (_.mpg / _.cyl).mean()
  )
)
```

Note there are 3 unique groupings for `cyl` (4, 6, and 8), so the resulting table has 3 rows.
