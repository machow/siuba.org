You may be wondering how a siuba function, like `mutate()`, could work on a SQL database.
This is because these functions are defined using a technique called single dispatch.
This approach allows you to define class-specific versions of a function.

```{python}
# ðŸš§ TODO: expose verb_dispatch on siu module
import pandas as pd

from siuba.siu.dispatchers import verb_dispatch
from siuba.data import mtcars
```

## Create a new verb with `verb_dispatch()`

Use the `verb_dispatch()` decorator to create a new table verb function.

The code below creates a function called head(), with an implementation that works specifically on a DataFrame.

```{python}

# DataFrame version of function ---

@verb_dispatch(pd.DataFrame)
def head(__data, n = 5):
    return __data.head(n)

head(mtcars, 2)
```

## Register a SQL translation

We can define a SQL specific version, that acts on a SqlAlchemy Table by registering a new translation of our function `head`, with the `@head.register` decorator.

```{python}
from sqlalchemy import Table, Column, MetaData

@head.register
def _head_sql(__data: Table, n = 5):
    return __data.select().limit(n)

table = Table("some_table", MetaData(), Column('a'), Column('b'))
print(
    head(table, 2)
)
```

## Why not use methods?

Why use singledispatch rather than create a class method like `mtcars.head()`?

There are two big benefits:

1. **Anyone can define and package a function**. Using it is just a matter of importing it. With a method, you need to somehow put it onto the class representing your data. You end up with 300+ methods on a class.
2. Your function might do something that is **not the class's core responsibility**. In this case, it should not be part of the class definition.

See the post [Single dispatch for democratizing data science tools](https://mchow.com/posts/2020-02-24-single-dispatch-data-science/) for more.

## Grouped data


Since single dispatch functions define how to execute an action for a specific class of data, it allows siuba to handle grouped data in two ways:

* pandas - register dispatchers for its special grouped data classes (`DataFrameGroupBy`, `SeriesGroupBy`).
* SQL - use a single class for grouped and ungrouped data, with grouping info as an attribute (`siuba.sql.LazyTbl`).

For example, here is a simple verb that calculates the number of rows in a grouped DataFrame.

```{python}
from pandas.core.groupby import DataFrameGroupBy
@verb_dispatch(DataFrameGroupBy)
def size(__data):
    return __data.size()
size(mtcars.groupby('cyl'))
```

## Handling indexes

Most siuba table verbs take a DataFrame, and return a DataFrame.
Moreover, they don't stick columns onto the index.
This means you don't need to call `reset_index` all the time.

A common place where `reset_index` is called is after a pandas grouped aggregation.

```{python}
from siuba.data import mtcars
from siuba import summarize
g_cyl = mtcars.groupby("cyl")
agg_res = g_cyl[["hp", "mpg"]].agg("mean")
# nooooo
agg_res
```

## verb_dispatch()


One thing to note is that siuba's singledispatch implementation is called `singledispatch2`. This function (whose name will likely change!) is a very light wrapper around python's built in `functools.singledispatch` that does two things:

1. Allow verbs to be piped using `data >> verb1() >> verb2()` syntax.
2. Strip out the symbolic part of lazy expressions.

These two concepts are covered in the next two sections.
