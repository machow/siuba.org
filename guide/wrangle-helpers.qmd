```{python}
#| include: false

import pandas as pd

pd.set_option("display.max_rows", 5)
```

Some combinations of verbs and column operations get used so frequently that they
earn their own helper verbs. These helpers make things a little quicker or concise to type.

This page discusses 3 helper functions that will super charge your workflow:

* `count()`: tally up values in the data.
* `separate()`: split a string column into separate columns (e.g. "a-1" -> "a" and "1").
* `complete()`: expand and enhance data with all combinations of specific columns.

```{python}
import pandas as pd
from siuba import _, count, separate, complete

```

## Count values

## Separate strings into columns

## Complete combinations of data
