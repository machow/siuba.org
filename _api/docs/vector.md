## Importing

```python
from siuba.dply.vector import n, lead, lag
```

::: siuba.dply.vector
    options:
      show_root_full_path: true

## Conditionals

Note that these functions currently can be imported from the top level:

```python
from siuba import case_when, if_else
```

They will be moved into the `siuba.dply.vector` module, but the above import will
continue to work for backwards compatibility.

::: siuba.case_when
    options:
      heading_level: 3

::: siuba.if_else
    options:
      heading_level: 3
